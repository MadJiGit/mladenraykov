      "description": "A powerful browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, and Safari that helps users filter unwanted content and remove distracting websites from search results.",
      "projectOverview": "BlockLang is a sophisticated cross-platform browser extension (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) that implements advanced real-time search result filtering using dual-architecture approach: DOM manipulation with MutationObserver API and URL query modification. Built with vanilla JavaScript ES6+ and Chrome Extension Manifest V3, the extension features comprehensive CSS selector targeting, intelligent URL parsing, and client-side filter management using Chrome Storage API. The technical implementation includes service worker background scripts, content script injection, and responsive UI with dark/light theme support. Currently serving 5,000+ users, the project is evolving into a SaaS platform with planned backend implementation (PHP/Symfony + MySQL) to enable Pro subscriptions with cross-device synchronization, user accounts, and premium filtering features - addressing the limitation that App Stores don't support paid extensions. This full-stack expansion will demonstrate end-to-end product development from browser extension to complete SaaS business model.",
